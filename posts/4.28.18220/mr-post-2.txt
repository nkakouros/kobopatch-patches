[U][B]Changes to the kobopatch zip:[/B][/U]
[B]v72 (2021-10-21)[/B]: Initial release for 4.28.18220.

[B][U]Missing patches:[/U][/B]
- geek1011: ePub uniform font scale (this will need a complete rewrite for 18220+ since the logic has been completely reworked; also note that it may not be necessary on certain devices anymore)
- GeoffR: Set font scale factor (same reason)

[B][U]New patches in this version:[/U][/B]
- None yet.

[B][U]Other notes:[/U][/B]
- I do not recommend mixing and matching kobo8 (Elipsa) and kobo3-7 firmware. There are non-insignificant differences in the rootfs which may cause issues. For example, Foxit is used for PDFs on the Elipsa, but it isn't included at all on non-kobo8 packages.
