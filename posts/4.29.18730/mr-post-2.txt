[B][U]Missing patches:[/U][/B]
- geek1011: ePub uniform font scale (this will need a complete rewrite for 18220+ since the logic has been completely reworked; also note that it may not be necessary on certain devices anymore)
- GeoffR: Set font scale factor (same reason)

[B][U]New patches in this version:[/U][/B]

[B][U]Removed patches in this version:[/U][/B]
- geek1011: Change Browse Kobo home screen link target - Articles (this isn't possible anymore due to firmware changes)

[B][U]Other notes:[/U][/B]
- I do not recommend mixing and matching kobo8/9 (Elipsa, Libra2, Sage) and kobo3-7 firmware. There are non-insignificant differences in the rootfs which may cause issues. For example, Foxit is used for PDFs on the Elipsa, but it isn't included at all on non-kobo8/9 packages.
- If you install kobo8/9 firmware on an older device, you may run into [URL="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4164605&postcount=35"]space issues[/URL] (thanks for pointing this out, @davidfor).
